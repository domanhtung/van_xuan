        Despite having a good market, the pharmaceutical manufacturing in
        Vietnam still faces many difficulties. This difficulty comes from
        industry competition, world competition and technological development.
        In order for the pharmaceutical manufacturing to develop, what should
        pharmaceutical enterprises do?

        Overview of Vietnam’s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry 2023.

      <div className="pt-3 text-[18px] lg:text-[22px] text-[#002856] font-bold">
        The market for the pharmaceutical industry in Vietnam is relatively
        active:
      </div>
      <p className="pt-3">
        The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Vietnam is classified as a
        rapidly growing industry.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Especially in 2022, the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry witnessed
        remarkable growth. According to a general report, Vietnam’s
        pharmaceutical market is valued at about 6.2-6.4 billion USD/year.
        Vietnam’s pharmaceutical market is also forecast to reach 16.1 billion
        USD in 2026. According to VIRAC’s report, in the first quarter of 2023,
        the industrial production index of this industry group achieved a growth
        rate of nearly 7% over the same period last year.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Domestic pharmaceutical production is expanding in scale.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        According to the latest report of VIRAC, Vietnam has 51 foreign-invested
        pharmaceutical enterprises. 228 enterprises met WHO – GMP standards
        (World Health Organization – WTO Good Manufacturing Practice). 18
        enterprises meet high GMP standards such as EU, PICs, JAPAN, TCA. 3
        facilities with PIC/S-GMP production lines: Fresenius Kabi Bidiphar (HSA
        Singapore); Korea United (Korea).
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        The above figures show that Vietnam’s pharmaceutical manufacturing
        industry has really made quite a step forward. Pharmaceutical
        manufacturing enterprises invest more, achieve better manufacturing
        practice standards. Moreover, the pharmaceutical distribution system in
        Vietnam is relatively developed. In particular, the drugstore system is
        developing widely across the country.

        Limitations of the pharmaceutical industry in Vietnam.
      </div>
      <p className="pt-3">
        It can be said that the pharmaceutical market in Vietnam is developing
        very well. However, the pharmaceutical industry in Vietnam still has
        many limitations.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Limit 1: The pharmaceutical industry lacks connection with advanced
        technology and techniques.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Many drug factories in Vietnam only produce pharmaceutical products with
        simple production lines. Factories also focus on generic drugs, which
        are bioequivalent to invention drugs (generic drugs). The reason is that
        the production plants lack connection with modern technology, new
        preparation techniques, … It is sad that more than 90% of raw materials
        for domestic pharmaceutical production have to be imported.

        Limit 2: The pharmaceutical industry has not yet mastered the Vietnamese
        market
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Such a good consumption market, Vietnam’s pharmaceutical market is still
        a “playground” for foreign businesses. In the period from 2015 to 2021,
        the value of domestic pharmaceutical production is still low. This
        figure only reached 46% of the total value of drug use of the people.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        This rate has increased significantly compared to the previous period
        (2001-2011) but is still low compared to the world. The reason is that
        the pharmaceutical industry in Vietnam has not been able to produce
        specific products. Most of the drugs produced in the country are only
        used to treat common and chronic diseases.

        Direction for enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry
      </div>
      <p className="pt-3">
        With the existing consumption market, pharmaceutical enterprises in
        Vietnam need to improve their competitiveness with foreign enterprises.
      </p>
      <div className="pt-3 text-[18px] lg:text-[22px] text-[#002856] font-bold">
        The first direction for pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises: To
        stay ahead of technology:
      </div>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Up to now, when the need for essential therapeutic drugs is essential,
        the basic is usually covered. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry
        needs to focus its resources on the more difficult stages of the
        pharmaceutical industry. For example, research, testing, development,
        production of specialized drugs, special treatments, rare drugs,
        invention drugs… This will help businesses reduce dependence on foreign
        medicinal products.

      <p className="pt-3">
        Advanced technology is always the key when it comes to growth and
        competitiveness. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises
        need to apply advanced science and technology to production. However,
        applying advanced technology to production is a relatively difficult
        task for small and medium enterprises. Therefore, leading large
        enterprises in the industry need to be pioneers in the development and
        application of science and technology to production.

        Take advantage of available potentials and strengths:

      <p className="pt-3">
        On the other hand, businesses need to apply technology to fully exploit
        the inherent strengths of our country. It is a rich source of medicinal
        herbs and high-quality human resources in the country. In order to raise
        the ranking of Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry on the world map,
        pharmaceutical manufacturers must “take shortcuts, catch up” with
        technology and bring into full play the capacity of the pharmaceutical
        industry. In particular, it is necessary to promote investment in
        research, testing and development of biological drugs, invention drugs….

        Reduce competition among enterprises by dividing industry groups:
      </div>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Generic drug market share is already small, plus many companies produce
        together, leading to fierce competition. This leads to inefficient
        production and business activities of enterprises. It is this that makes
        Vietnamese businesses lack competitiveness with businesses in the world.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-3">
        Therefore, it is necessary to divide each pharmaceutical manufacturing
        enterprise into a different product niche. This will reduce competition
        among domestic enterprises and diversify products. By doing this,
        Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry will have more competitiveness with
        foreign enterprises.
